#### What is a Post?

A **Post** is an update entry inside a project’s changelog. It represents a version release, announcement, fix, or improvement — and can be as simple or as detailed as needed.

Each post can contain:

- Title & short description
- Structured content blocks (text, lists, code, images, etc.)
- Tags and categories
- Publish date and visibility settings

#### Content Blocks

Posts are built using blocks. You can mix and match them to structure content your way:

- **Text** – Paragraphs or formatted text
- **Heading** – Section titles inside the post
- **List** – Bullet points or numbered lists
- **Code** – Code snippets with syntax highlighting
- **Version** – Display the version number for the update
- **Category** – Label the type of update (e.g., Feature, Fix)
- **Divider** – Visual separator between sections
- **Image** – Embedded screenshots or illustrations
- **Video** – Embed videos (e.g., demos or walkthroughs)
- **More blocks** - (_Coming Soon)_
