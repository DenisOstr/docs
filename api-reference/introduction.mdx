## Welcome to the **Loglybase API**.

Our RESTful API lets you create and manage changelog content, projects, and more — all from your own applications.

#### What you can do with the API:

- Create and update changelog posts
- Manage your projects and settings
- Fetch structured changelog data

### Authentication

All API requests require a **API Token**.\
You can generate and manage your tokens in the dashboard under **Settings → API**.

```yaml
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
