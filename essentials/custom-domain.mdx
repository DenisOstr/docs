#### What is a Custom Domain?

With **Custom Domains**, you can serve your changelog on a domain you own — like `updates.yourcompany.com` — making it feel fully integrated into your product or website.

This allows for:

- Branded changelog pages
- Better trust and consistency for your users
- SEO benefits and custom analytics if needed

#### How to Set Up a Custom Domain

To set up a custom domain:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Open the **Project settings** section
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `changelog.example.com`)
4. Follow the DNS instructions (CNAME record)
5. Wait for verification and SSL provisioning

#### DNS Configuration

Depending on your domain provider, you’ll usually need to:

- **Add a CNAME record** pointing to `loglybase.com`

Propagation may take a few minutes to several hours.

#### SSL & Security

Once verified, we automatically issue and renew an SSL certificate for your domain via Let’s Encrypt — no manual setup required.

#### Troubleshooting

If your domain isn’t verifying:

- Double-check DNS propagation using tools like `dnschecker.org`
- Make sure no conflicting records exist (e.g., other CNAME records)
- Contact your domain registrar if the record isn’t being accepted
- Contact us to resolve domain issues
